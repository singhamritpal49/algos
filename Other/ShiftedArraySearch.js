// Shifted Array Search
// A sorted array of distinct integers shiftArr is shifted to the left by an unknown offset and you don’t have a pre-shifted copy of it. For instance, the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 becomes 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, after shifting it twice to the left.

// Given shiftArr and an integer num, implement a function shiftedArrSearch that finds and returns the index of num in shiftArr. If num isn’t in shiftArr, return -1. Assume that the offset can be any value between 0 and arr.length - 1.

// Explain your solution and analyze its time and space complexities.

// Example:

// input:  shiftArr = [9, 12, 17, 2, 4, 5], num = 2 # shiftArr is the
//                                                  # outcome of shifting
//                                                  # [2, 4, 5, 9, 12, 17]
//                                                  # three times to the left

// output: 3 # since it’s the index of 2 in arr

// Solution

// For a shifted array, binary search cannot be straightforwardly applied, since it’s no longer sorted. Instead, what we can do is to choose “smartly” a pivot point where the shifted array will be partitioned precisely into two fully sorted (in an ascending order) sub-arrays. Once done, we apply binary search on the relevant sub-array.

// For instance, for the example above, the pivot point is index 3 and two sub-arrays are [9, 12, 17] and [2, 4, 5]. Notice that each array is indeed fully sorted.

// So how do we choose a pivot point? Well, the desired pivot point is the index that satisfies the following condition: shiftArr[i-1] > shiftArr[i]. There could be maximum only one such index since the values are distinct and the array was shifted to the left.

// To find the pivot point, we could easily scan shiftArr linearly until we find an index that meets the condition above. However, a more efficient way will be to use modified version of binary search. On each step, we check whether the current shiftArr[i] is smaller than its left neighbor. If it is, then we we’ve found our pivot.

// Otherwise, we determine what half of the array we need to focus on by comparing shiftArr[mid] to shiftArr[0]. This comparison will tell us if the current mid index is part of the shifted sub-array or the other sub-array.

// Once we have found the pivot point and split the array, we can apply binary search only on the relevant sub-array and ignore the other sub-array. The relevant sub-array would satisfy: subArr[0] ≤ num ≤ subArr[n-1].

// Pseudocode:

// function shiftedArrSearch(shiftArr, num):
//     pivot = findPivotPoint(shiftArr)

//     if(pivot == 0 OR num < shiftArr[0]):
//         return binarySearch(shiftArr, pivot, shiftArr.length - 1, num)
    
//     return binarySearch(shiftArr, 0, pivot - 1, num)


// function findPivotPoint(arr):
//     begin = 0
//     end = arr.length - 1

//     while (begin <= end):
//         mid = begin + floor((end - begin)/2)
//         if (mid == 0 OR arr[mid] < arr[mid-1]):
//             return mid
//         if (arr[mid] > arr[0]):
//             begin = mid + 1
//         else:
//             end = mid - 1

//     return 0


// function binarySearch(arr, begin, end, num):
//     while (begin <= end):
//         mid = begin + floor((end - begin)/2)
//         if (arr[mid] < num):
//             begin = mid + 1
//         else if (arr[mid] == num):
//             return mid
//         else:
//             end = mid - 1

//     return -1


// Hints & Tips
// A common mistake is to try to solve by concatenating the shifted array to itself. E.g. [9, 12, 17, 2, 4, 5, 9, 12, 17, 2, 4, 5] for the example above. While this might seem right at first glance, there isn’t really a good way to identify the part of the array that we need to focus on in order to find the index of num.
// If your peer is stuck, ask them how they’d go about finding a number in a regular (i.e. unshifted) sorted array. Hint: Binary Search.
// If your peer doesn’t understand binary search, go ahead and explain it to them. Be sure to reduce their rating on ‘problem solving’ in the feedback from, though.
// Make sure that your peer fully implements the binary search algorithm since they’re going to need it anyway as part of the full solution.
// Watch out for mistakes with index calculations, e.g. division results not rounded, going out of an array bounds, forgotten indices etc.
// To be considered optimal, the solution must achieve O(log((N)) time complexity.
