# Binary Search Trees OBJECTIVES
- Define what a tree is
- Compare and contrast trees and lists
- Explain the differences between trees, binary trees, and binary search trees
- Implement operations on binary search trees

# TREE TERMINOLOGY
- Root - The top node in a tree.
- Child -A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root.
- Parent - The converse notion of a child.
- Siblings -A group of nodes with the same parent.
- Leaf - A node with no children.
- Edge - The connection between one node and another.

# How BSTS WORK
- Every parent node has at most two children
- Every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent
- Every node to the right of a parent node is always greater than the parent
